DESCRIPTION

    A list of movies for the Daleks. A collective work of "#perl". See
    <http://use.perl.org/~statico/journal/21689>

    I've tried to remove all the duplicates and comments I could find, but
    there are probably still a few left. Don't hesitate to send patch to
    remove wrong entries or to propose new entries.
